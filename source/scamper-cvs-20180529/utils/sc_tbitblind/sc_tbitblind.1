.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use that instance to test systems for resilience to blind
TCP attacks, with the output written to a file in warts format.
The utility tests a given system for regular TCP behavior, and then
tests the system for response to reset, SYN, and data packets that could
have come from a blind attacker because the sequence number is not the
next sequence number value expected by the receiver (the reset and SYN
cases) or the acknowledgment value covers data ahead or behind the
receiver's point in their sequence number space (the data cases).
The utility also tests the system's response to a connection that
advertises support for window scaling, TCP timestamps, and Selective
Acknowledgments (SACK).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl a Ar addressfile
specifies the name of the input file which constists of a sequence
of systems to test, one system per line.
.It Fl A Ar application
specifies the type of application to simulate while testing the system.
Options are HTTP and BGP.
.It Fl c Ar completed-file
specifies the name of a file to record IP addresses that have been tested.
.It Fl l Ar limit-per-file
specifies the number of tbit objects to record per warts file, before opening
a new file and placing new objects.
.It Fl o Ar output-file
specifies the name of the file to be written.  The output file will use
the warts format.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy noshuffle:
do not shuffle the order of the input list or the order of the tests.
.El
.It Fl p Ar scamper-port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl r
causes the random number generator used to shuffle tests be seeded.
.It Fl t Ar log-file
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl T Ar ttl
specifies the IP-TTL to use with the blind TCP tests.
.It Fl w Ar wait-between
specifies the length of time to wait between any two TCP tests to one
system.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Use of this driver requires a scamper instance listening on a port for
commands, which has been configured to use the IPFW firewall rules 1 to
100, as follows:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -P 31337 -F ipfw:1-100
.Pp
To test a set of web servers specified in a file named webservers.txt and
formatted as follows:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
1,example.com 1263 192.0.2.1 http://www.example.com/
1,example.com 1263 2001:DB8::1 http://www.example.com/
1,example.com 1263 2001:DB8::2 https://www.example.com/
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
the following command will test all servers for resilience to blind
TCP attacks and record raw data into webservers_00.warts,
webservers_01.warts, etc:
.Pp
.Dl sc_tbitblind -a webservers.txt -p 31337 -o webservers
.Pp
The webservers.txt file is required to be formatted as above.
The format is: numeric ID to pass to tbit, a label for the webserver,
the size of the object to be fetched, the IP address to contact, and the
URL to use.
.Pp
To test a set of BGP routers specified in bgprouters.txt and formatted
as follows:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
192.0.2.2 65000
192.0.2.2 65001
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
the following command will test all BGP routers for resilience to blind
TCP attacks, without shuffling the test order, waiting 180 seconds
between tests, and record raw data into bgprouters_00.warts,
bgprouters_01.warts, etc:
.Pp
.Dl sc_tbitblind -a bgprouters.txt -p 31337 -o bgprouters -A bgp -O noshuffle -w 180
.Pp
The bgprouters.txt file is required to be formatted as above.
The format of that file is: IP address to establish a BGP session
with, and the ASN to use.
