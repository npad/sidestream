.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use it to map the first hop border routers of networks
using the "bdrmap" technique.
.Nm
uses targeted traceroutes, alias resolution techniques, knowledge
of traceroute idiosyncrasies, and codification of topologicial
constraints in a structured set of constraints, to correctly identify
interdomain links at the granularity of individual border routers.
.Nm
operates in two distinct modes: data collection, and data analysis.
.Pp
In the data collection mode,
.Nm
uses Paris traceroute with ICMP-echo probes to trace the paths towards
every distinct address block, using a stop-set to avoid re-probing portions
of paths that do not provide useful constraints for the first hop border
routers, as well as alias resolution techniques (Mercator, Ally, Prefixscan,
and the Too-Big-Trick) to collapse the interface graph into a router-level
topology.
.Nm
will also use probes with the record-route and pre-specified timestamp
IP-level options to collect additional information on the return path
from a router, where the probes are usable.
.Pp
In the data analysis mode,
.Nm
uses the collected data to infer a router-level topology of the
hosting network and the interconnecting routers belonging to the
hosting network's neighbors.
.Pp
The supported options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 6
specifies that
.Nm
should infer IPv6 border routers, and that the input files are for the
IPv6 topology.  This feature is currently work in progress.
.It Fl a Ar ip2as-file
specifies the IP prefix to Autonomous System (AS) mapping file that
.Nm
should use when collecting and analysing topology data.  See the examples
section for a description of how this file must be formatted.
.It Fl A
specifies the AS numbers (ASNs) that
.Nm
should collect data towards.  This option is useful for testing and
debugging.
.It Fl c Ar allyconf
specifies the number of times that
.Nm
should repeat pair-wise alias inferences that were made implying a
central shared IP-ID counter.  By default, each pair of aliases is tested
five additional times at 5 minute intervals because two IP addresses
belonging to two different routers could happen to return IP-ID values
that imply a central shared IP-ID counter.
.It Fl d Ar dump
specifies the dump ID to use to analyze the collected data.
Currently, ID values 1 (routers) and 2 (traces) are valid, which dumps
inferred routers and annotated traceroute paths, respectively.
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to detach and become a daemon.
.It Fl f Ar firsthop
specifies the first hop in a traceroute path that
.Nm
should begin at when collecting traceroute paths.  If
.Nm
is being run behind a NAT router, the private IP address of that router
is uninteresting, and this option allows that hop to be skipped.
.It Fl g Ar delegated-file
specifies an IP address delegations file that can be provided to
.Nm
to allow inferences in the analysis phase of who operates unrouted IP
address space.
.It Fl i
specifies the IP addresses that
.Nm
should collect data towards.  This option is useful for testing and
debugging.
.It Fl l Ar log-file
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl n Ar names-file
specifies the name of a file containing IP address to domain name system
names.
.It Fl o Ar output-file
specifies the name of the output file to be written during the data collection
phase.  The output file will use the
.Xr warts 5
format.
.It Fl O Ar option
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.  The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy dumpborders:
only dump inferred border routers, not all VP routers.
.It
.Sy dumponedsts:
further annotate routers that were only observed towards one AS.
.It
.Sy dumptracesets:
dump the traceroutes observed towards networks where no topology
was observed to be routed by a neighbor network.
.It
.Sy impatient:
probe the destination ASes in order of number of address blocks, so
that the probing will complete fastest.
.It
.Sy nogss:
do not use a global stop set when collecting topology.
.It
.Sy noipopts:
do not probe with IP record route and IP prespecified timestamp options.
.It
.Sy nomerge:
do not analytically merge IP interfaces to routers based on common
adjacent neighbor routers.
.It
.Sy noself:
do not report links to other routers operated by the network hosting the
vantage point.
.It
.Sy randomdst:
probe a random address in each address block, rather than the first.
.El
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl r Ar relationships-file
specifies the AS relationships file which is used in the analysis phase
to reason about who owns each router in the observed topology.
.It Fl R Ar unix
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where a remote
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting remote control socket connections.
.It Fl U Ar unix
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where a local
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl v Ar vpases
specifies the name of a file, or a list of ASes, that represent the
network hosting the vantage point.
.It Fl x Ar ixp-file
specifies the name of a file that contains a list of prefixes used by
an IXP to enable interconnection at their facilities.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of prefixes with origin AS in a file named ip2as.txt, a list
of VP ases in vpases.txt, a list of IXP prefixes in ixp.txt, and a
.Xr scamper 1
instance listening on port 31337 configured to probe at 100 packets
per second started as follows:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -P 31337 -p 100
.Pp
the following command will collect raw topology data to support inference
of border routers for the network hosting the vantage point, storing raw
data into bdrmap.warts, and logging run-time information into logfile1.txt:
.Pp
.Dl sc_bdrmap -p 31337 -o bdrmap.warts -l logfile1.txt -a ip2as.txt -v vpases.txt -x ixp.txt
.Pp
To infer border routers from the collected data, using the same input files
as above, with a set of AS relationships contained in asrel.txt, and a
set of prefix delegations assembled from the Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
Statistics files in delegated.txt:
.Pp
.Dl sc_bdrmap -d routers -a ip2as.txt -g delegated.txt -r asrel.txt -v vpases.txt -x ixp.txt bdrmap.warts >bdrmap.routers.txt
.Pp
To view annotated traceroutes stored in bdrmap.warts with IP to DNS names
information stored in names.txt:
.Pp
.Dl sc_bdrmap -d traces -a ip2as.txt -v vpases.txt -x ixp.txt -n names.txt bdrmap.wart >bdrmap.traces.txt
