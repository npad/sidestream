.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a simple dump of information contained in a sequence of
warts files.
The output is the same as that which would have been provided by scamper
if the text output option had been chosen instead of the warts output
option when the data was collected.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar ip2descr-file
specifies the name of a file with IP-address, description mappings, one
mapping per line.  See the examples section for further information.
.El
.Pp
While the output of
.Nm
is structured and suitable for initial analyses of results,
the format of the output is not suitable for automated parsing and analysis
as the output of
.Nm
will change overtime with no regard to backwards compatibility.
Analyses of the contents of a warts file should be made using specialised
programs which link against the scamper file API.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
sc_warts2text file1.warts file2.warts
.in -.3i
.Pp
will decode and print the contents of file1.warts, followed by the contents
of file2.warts.
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
gzcat file1.warts.gz | sc_warts2text
.in -.3i
.Pp
will print the contents of the uncompressed file supplied on stdin.
.Pp
Given a set of IP-address, description pairs in a file name mappings.txt:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
192.0.2.1 "foo"
192.0.2.2 "bar"
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
then the command gzcat file1.warts.gz | sc_warts2text -d mappings.txt will
print the description associated with a given destination address before each
result is presented.
