.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a
.Xr scamper 1
instance running remotely and interact with it by issuing commands
and receiving results in warts format.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to operate as a daemon.
.It Fl 4
causes
.Nm
to only listen for IPv4-based connections.
.It Fl 6
causes
.Nm
to only listen for IPv6-based connections.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy allowgroup:
allow members of the unix domain socket's group to access to the
unix domain sockets created by
.Nm
.It
.Sy allowother:
allow anyone on the system access to the unix domain sockets created by
.Nm
.It
.Sy select:
use
.Xr select 2
with all sockets, rather than
.Xr epoll 2
or
.Xr kqueue 2
.El
.It Fl P Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Nm
should listen for incoming connections.
.It Fl U Ar directory
specifies the directory on the local host where unix domain sockets
corresponding to remote hosts should be placed.
.It Fl c Ar tls-certificate
specifies the server certificate file in PEM format to advertise to
remote
.Xr scamper 1
instances.
.It Fl p Ar tls-privatekey
specifies the private key file in PEM format that corresponds to the
certificate file.  This key should have a passphrase.
.Nm
will prompt for the passphrase when starting up.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The intended use of the remote control socket built into
.Xr scamper 1
is as follows.
A central server with IP addresses 192.0.2.1 and 2001:db8::1
runs a
.Nm
process listening on a port for remote scamper process, placing
control sockets in a specified directory:
.Pp
.Dl sc_remoted -P 31337 -U scamper-remote-sockets
.Pp
Then, a remote host with IP address 198.51.100.55 runs scamper
and connects to the remote controller:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -R 192.0.2.1:31337
.Pp
The
.Nm
process places a unix domain socket in the directory corresponding to
the remote process.  The name corresponds to the source IP address and
port the remote scamper process connected to controller with.  If the
scamper process used source port 1025, then the unix domain socket's
name will be
.Pp
.Dl scamper-remote-sockets/198.51.100.55:1025
.Pp
If a second remote host with IP address 2001:db8:1234::1 runs scamper
and connects to the remote controller:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -R [2001:db8::1]:31337
.Pp
The same
.Nm
process will place another unix domain socket in the directory
corresponding to the remote process.  If the scamper process used
source port 1026, then the unix domain socket's name will be
.Pp
.Dl scamper-remote-sockets/2001:db8:1234::1.1026
.Pp
.\""""""""""""
.Sh USING TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY
.Nm
and scamper support the use of transport layer security (TLS) using
OpenSSL to authenticate and encrypt communications between
.Nm
and scamper.
To use this support requires a public certificate signed by a
certificate authority.
Scamper will verify the certificate presented by
.Nm
and disconnect if the certificate presented by
.Nm
cannot be validated.
.Pp
Generating a certificate that will be accepted by scamper requires you
to create a certificate request and pass it for signing to a
certificate authority.
To generate a private key in file remotepriv.pem, and a request to
sign the key in remotereq.pem:
.Pp
.Dl openssl req -new -keyout remotepriv.pem -out remotereq.pem
.Pp
and then send the remotereq.pem file to the certificate authority for
signing.
Do not send remotepriv.pem; that key must remain private to you.
When openssl prompts for a passphrase, choose a passphrase that is
unique and keep the passphrase secret.
When your chosen certificate authority signs your private key, it will
return a file which we will call remotecert.pem.
Both remotecert.pem and remotepriv.pem are required parameters to
.Nm
to enable TLS support:
.Pp
.Dl sc_remoted -P 31337 -U scamper-remote-sockets -c remotecert.pem -p remotepriv.pem
.Pp
and then passing the -O tls option to scamper:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -R example.com:31337 -O tls
.Pp
