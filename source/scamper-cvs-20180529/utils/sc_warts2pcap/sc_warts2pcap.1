.Sh NAME
.Nm sc_warts2pcap
.Nd write packets included in warts object to a pcap file.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl s Ar sort
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to extract packets embedded in the tbit, sting,
and sniff warts objects and write them to a pcap file, which can be read by
tcpdump and wireshark.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file.  If no output file is specified,
it will be written to the standard output, provided that it is not a tty.
.It Fl o Ar sort
specifies how the pcap records (packets) are sorted before being written
out.  By default, no sorting is applied; the packets are grouped as they
are in the warts file.  If packet sorting is specified, the packets are
written out in timestamp order.  Note that this operation requires the
packets to be read into memory to be sorted, so it will require a
corresponding amount of memory to complete.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
sc_warts2pcap -o output.pcap file1.warts file2.warts
.in -.3i
.Pp
will read the packet objects from file1.warts, and then file2.warts, and
write them to output.pcap.
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
gzcat file1.warts.gz | sc_warts2pcap -s packet >file1.pcap
.in -.3i
.Pp
will read the contents of the uncompressed warts file supplied on stdin,
sort the packets by their timestamp, and then write the output to file1.pcap.
