.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use it to collect data to infer if an IPv4 link is likely a
point-to-point link using the prefixscan method.
An address B is the in-bound interface of a router in a traceroute path if
we find an alias A' of the address A returned for the previous hop and A'
is a /31 or /30 mate of B, i.e. the link between A and B is a point-to-point
link.
The prefixscan method infers A and A' are aliases if the IPIDs in responses
to five alternating probes sent one second apart monotonically increase and
differ by no more than 1,000, or probes to A and A' elicit responses with
a common source address.
The first technique is a pairwise comparison similar to Ally, and the second
is the Mercator technique.
The supported options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to detach and become a daemon.
.It Fl i Ar infile
specifies a file containing a list of IPv4 address pairs adjacent in
traceroute paths to test if they are point-to-point links.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file to be written during the data collection
phase.  The output file will use the
.Xr warts 5
format.
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl r Ar data-file
specifies the name of the data file to be parsed for point-to-point link
inferences that were collected by
.Nm
in a previous data collection.
.It Fl U Ar unix-socket
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where a local
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl w Ar wait
specifies the length of time in seconds to wait between probing the same
IPv4 address with different methods.
By default,
.Nm
waits five seconds between methods.
.It Fl x Ar prefixlen
specifies the maximum size of prefix to consider.
By default,
.Nm
considers up to an IPv4 /30 prefix.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a traceroute with the following path:
.Pp
.Dl traceroute to 192.0.30.64
.Dl  1 192.0.2.1
.Dl  2 192.0.32.10
.Dl  3 192.0.31.8
.Dl  4 192.0.30.64
.Pp
then to collect data to infer if the implied IPv4 links are point-to-point,
put the links in a file named infile.txt formatted as follows:
.Pp
.Dl 192.0.2.1 192.0.32.10
.Dl 192.0.32.10 192.0.31.8
.Dl 192.0.31.8 192.0.30.64
.Pp
and use a
.Xr scamper 1
daemon listening on port 31337 using:
.Pp
.Dl sc_prefixscan -i infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337
.Pp
To obtain the inferred point-to-point links from outfile.warts:
.Pp
.Dl sc_prefixscan -r outfile.warts
