The

option when the data was collected.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
sc_warts2json file1.warts file2.warts
.in -.3i
.Pp
will decode and print the contents of file1.warts, followed by the contents
of file2.warts.
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
gzcat file1.warts.gz | sc_warts2json
.in -.3i
.Pp
will print the contents of the uncompressed file supplied on stdin.
