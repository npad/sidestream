.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and infer which of the supplied IPv4 addresses are aliases using the
Radargun technique.
For all addresses in the file,
.Nm
establishes which probe methods (UDP, TCP-ack, ICMP-echo) solicit an
incrementing IP-ID value, and then uses the Radargun technique on
addresses where a probe method is able to obtain an incrementing IP-ID
for the addresses.
The output is written to a warts file.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to detach and become a daemon.
.It Fl a Ar infile
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a list of IPv4
addresses.  The file can either contain sets to test, one set per line,
or simply one set, one address per line.
.It Fl d Ar dump
specifies the dump ID to use to analyze the collected data.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy 1:
dump inferred aliases.
.It
.Sy 2:
dump interface classifications.
.El
.It Fl f Ar fudge
specifies the fudge to use when inferring if a device is deriving
IP-ID values from a counter.  By default, responses the maximum
difference between two samples must be no larger than 5000.  The fudge
value also impacts alias inference.  If a value of zero is used, the
IP-ID samples must simply be in order.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the warts format.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy nobs:
do not consider if IP-ID values might be byte-swapped in the header
.It
.Sy nobudget:
do not consider if the radargun measurement can complete in the round
time give the packets-per-second rate specified.
.It
.Sy noradargun:
do not conduct radargun step.  Stop after classifying interface IP-ID
behavior.
.It
.Sy noreserved:
do not probe reserved IP addresses.
.It
.Sy rows:
the addresses in the input file are supplied in rows, and the radargun
measurements will probe and evaluate each set independently.
.It
.Sy tc:
when dumping candidate aliases, report the transitive closure, rather
than pairs in isolation.
.El
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl P Ar pps
specifies the packets-per-second rate that scamper is running at.  The
PPS value is used to infer if the radargun measurement can fit in
scamper's probe budget.
.It Fl q Ar attempts
specifies the number of probe packets to use to when inferring if
an IP address assigns IP-ID values from a counter.
.It Fl r Ar wait-round
specifies the length of time, in seconds, each round should aim to
complete in.  By default, 30 seconds.
.It Fl R Ar round-count
specifies the number of rounds to pursue in radargun.  By default,
30 rounds.
.It Fl t Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl U Ar unix
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where a local
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting control socket connections.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Nm
requires a
.Xr scamper 1
instance listening on a port for commands in order to collect data, at
20 packets per second:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
scamper -P 31337 -p 20
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
will start a
.Xr scamper 1
instance listening on port 31337 on the loopback interface.  To use
.Nm
to infer which addresses might be aliases, listed in a file named set-1.txt
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
192.0.2.2
192.0.32.10
192.0.30.64
192.0.31.8
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
the following command will test these IP addresses for aliases using
ICMP, UDP, and TCP probes (as appropriate) using the radargun technique
with 10 rounds, each round taking 4 seconds:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
sc_radargun -a set-1.txt -o set-1.warts -p 20 -r 4 -R 10
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
To use
.Nm
to infer which addresses might be aliases, listed in a file named set-2.txt
organized as sets of candidate aliases to test:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
192.0.2.2 192.0.32.10 192.0.30.64 192.0.31.8
192.0.2.3 192.0.32.11 192.0.30.65 192.0.31.9
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
the following command will test these organized sets of IP addresses for
aliases:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
sc_radargun -a set-2.txt -o set-2.warts -p 20 -O rows
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
To use data previously collected with
.Nm
and stored in set-2.warts, to infer likely aliases, reported in pairs:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
sc_radargun -d 1 set-2.warts
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
To use data previously collected with
.Nm
and stored in set-2.warts, to report interface IP-ID classifications:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
sc_radargun -d 2 set-2.warts
.fi
.in -.3i
