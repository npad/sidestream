.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use that instance to test end systems for their ability
to perform Path MTU Discovery, with the output written to a file in warts
format.
.Nm
first tests a given system for responsiveness to ICMP echo packets, and
then tests the given system's TCP stack response to ICMP packet too
big messages.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl a Ar address-file
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence
of systems to test, one system per line.
.It Fl A Ar ip2as-file
specifies the name of a file which consists of a mapping of prefixes
to ASes, one prefix per line.
.It Fl c Ar completed-file
specifies the name of a file to record IP addresses that have been tested.
.It Fl d Ar dump-id
specifies the dump ID to use to analyze the collected data.
Currently, ID values 1 (mssresults) and 2 (asnresults) are valid, which
report PMTUD behaviour according to the server's MSS or the server's origin
ASN.
.It Fl l Ar limit-per-file
specifies the number of tbit objects to record per warts file, before opening
a new file and placing new objects.
.It Fl m Ar maximum transmission unit
specifies the pseudo maximum transmission unit to use.  The available
choices are 0, 256, 576, 1280, 1480.  If 0 is chosen,
.Nm
will test each website with all available MTU choices in decreasing
size.
The default MTU value tested is 1280.
.It Fl o Ar output-file
specifies the name of the file to be written.  The output file will use
the warts format.
.It Fl p Ar scamper-port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl r
shuffle the order in which websites are tested.
.It Fl t Ar log-file
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl w Ar window-size
specifies the maximum number of tests to conduct in parallel.  The
window size value depends on the value of the -F parameter passed to the
.Xr scamper 1
instance.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Use of this driver requires a
.Xr scamper 1
instance listening on a port for commands with a configured firewall.
The following invocation uses
.Xr ipfw 8
firewall rules 1 to 100, with a corresponding window size of 100, and
an unrestricted packets per second rate, as follows:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -P 31337 -F ipfw:1-100 -w 100 -p 0
.Pp
To test a set of web servers specified in a file named webservers.txt and
formatted as follows:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
1,example.com 5063 192.0.2.1 http://www.example.com/
.br
1,example.com 5063 2001:DB8::1 http://www.example.com/
.br
1,example.com 5063 2001:DB8::2 https://www.example.com/
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
the following command will test all servers for responsiveness to
ICMP packet too big messages and record raw data into webservers_00.warts,
webservers_01.warts, etc:
.Pp
.Dl sc_tbitpmtud -a webservers.txt -p 31337 -o webservers
.Pp
The webservers.txt file is required to be formatted as above.
The format is: numeric ID to pass to tbit, a label for the webserver,
the size of the object to be fetched, the IP address to contact, and the
URL to use.
.Pp
To characterize PMTUD behaviour according to the server's advertised MSS
value:
.Pp
.Dl sc_tbitpmtud -d mssresults webservers_*.warts
.Pp
Given files with IPv4 prefixes in prefix2as4.txt and IPv6 prefixes in
prefix2as6.txt formatted as follows:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
2001:DB8::     48     64496
.br
2001:DB8:1::   48     64497
.br
192.0.2.0      24     64498
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
the following command will characterize PMTUD behaviour according to the
origin ASN of the server:
.Pp
.Dl sc_tbitpmtud -d asnresults -A prefix2as4.txt -A prefix2as6.txt webservers_*.warts
