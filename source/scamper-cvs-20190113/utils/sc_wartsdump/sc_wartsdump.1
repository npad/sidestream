.Sh NAME
.Nm sc_wartsdump
.Nd verbose dump of information contained in a warts file.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides a verbose dump of information contained in a sequence of warts
files.
While the output is structured and suitable for initial analyses of results,
the format of the output is not suitable for automated parsing and analysis
as the output of
.Nm
will change overtime with no regard to backwards compatibility.
Analyses of the contents of a warts file should be made using specialised
programs which link against the scamper file API.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
sc_wartsdump file1.warts file2.warts
.in -.3i
.Pp
will decode and print the contents of file1.warts, followed by the contents
of file2.warts.
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
gzcat file1.warts.gz | sc_wartsdump
.in -.3i
.Pp
will print the contents of the uncompressed file supplied on stdin.
