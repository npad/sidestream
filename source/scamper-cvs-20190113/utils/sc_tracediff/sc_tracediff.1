.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays pairs of traceroutes to a destination where the path has
changed.
It takes two warts files as input and displays paths where a hop differs
by its address.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
dump all traceroute pairs regardless of whether they have changed.
.It Fl m Ar method
specifies the method used to match pairs of traceroutes together.
If
.Ar dst
is specified, traceroutes are matched if the destination IP address of both
traces are the same.
If
.Ar userid
is specified, traceroutes are matched if the userid field of both traces are
the same.
If
.Ar dstuserid
is specified, traceroutes are matched if the destination IP address and
userid fields are the same.
By default, the destination IP address is used.
.It Fl n
names should be reported instead of IP addresses, where possible.
.El

.Nm
can be useful in network monitoring to identify when a forward IP path
has changed.
In this scenario, it is recommended that Paris traceroute is used with
the same UDP source and destination ports for each execution of scamper so
that only paths that have changed are identified, not merely alternate paths
visible due to per-flow load-balancing.
By default scamper uses a source port based on the process ID, which will
change with each execution of scamper.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
scamper -O warts -o file1.warts -c 'trace -P udp-paris -s 31337' -f list.txt
.in -.3i
.Pp
collects the forward IP paths towards a set of IP addresses found in list.txt
using 31337 as the UDP source port value.
If the above command is adjusted to subsequently collect file2.warts, then
we can identify paths that have subsequently changed with the command:
.Pp
.in +.3i
sc_tracediff file1.warts file2.warts
.in -.3i
.Pp
If Paris traceroute with ICMP probes is preferred, then the following
invocation of scamper is appropriate:
.Pp
.in +.3i
scamper -O warts -o file1.warts -c 'trace -P icmp-paris -d 31337' -f list.txt
.in -.3i
.Pp
In this case, scamper uses 31337 as the ICMP checksum value in each probe.
