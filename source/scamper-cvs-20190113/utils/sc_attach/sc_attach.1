.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance, have a set of commands defined in a file be executed, and the
output be written into a single file, in warts format.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl d
prints each command sent to
.Xr scamper 1
on stderr.
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to operate as a daemon.
.It Fl v
prints the current revision of
.Nm
and exits.
.It Fl c Ar command
specifies the
.Xr scamper 1
command to prepend to each address in the input file.
.It Fl i Ar infile
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence
of
.Xr scamper 1
commands or addresses (with the -c option), one per line.
If '-' is specified, commands are read from stdin.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the warts format.
If '-' is specified, output will be sent to stdout.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy random:
shuffle the input commands randomly.
.It
.Sy impatient:
send commands to scamper without waiting for scamper to ask for them.
.El
.It Fl p Ar [ip:]port
specifies the IP address and port where a
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
If an IP address is not specified,
.Nm
connects to the specified port on the local host.
.It Fl P Ar priority
specifies the mixing priority
.Xr scamper 1
should assign to the source.
.It Fl R Ar unix-domain
specifies the unix domain socket on the local host where a remote
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting commands.
.It Fl U Ar unix-domain
specifies the unix domain socket on the local host where a local
.Xr scamper 1
isntance is accepting commands.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of commands in a file named infile.txt:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
tbit -M 1280 -u 'http://www.example.com/' 2620:0:2d0:200::10
trace -P udp-paris -M 192.0.2.1
ping -P icmp-echo 192.0.32.10
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
and a
.Xr scamper 1
daemon listening on port 31337, then these commands can be executed using:
.Pp
sc_attach -i infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337
.Pp
Given a set of addresses in a file named infile2.txt:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
2620:0:2d0:200::10
192.0.2.1
192.0.32.10
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
these addresses can be pinged with
.Nm
operating as a daemon with:
.Pp
sc_attach -D -c 'ping' -i infile2.txt -o outfile2.warts -p 31337
