.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use it to collect data for alias resolution of a set of
IPv6 addresses using the "speedtrap" technique.
.Nm
induces each address to send fragmented ICMP echo replies, with the goal of obtaining
an incrementing Identifier (ID) field in the fragmentation header.
If two addresses are aliases, they will return ICMP echo replies with a monotonically
increasing value in the ID field because the ID field is implemented as a counter
shared amongst all interfaces.
.Nm
implements a scalable algorithm to quickly determine which addresses are aliases.
Further information about the algorithm is found in the "see also" section.
The supported options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar addressfile
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence of IPv6 addresses
to resolve for aliases, one address per line.
.It Fl A Ar aliasfile
specifies the name of an output file which will receive pairs of aliases, one
address-pair per line.
.It Fl d Ar dump
specifies the number identifying an analysis task to conduct.  Valid dump numbers
are 1-3.  See the examples section.
.It Fl I
specifies that the addressfile contains only interfaces known to send fragmentation
headers containing incrementing values.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the warts format.
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl s Ar stop
specifies the step at which
.Nm
should halt.
The available steps are "classify", "descend", "overlap", "descend2", "candidates",
and "ally".
.It Fl S Ar skipfile
specifies the name of an input file which contains known aliases that do not need
to be resolved, one address-pair per line.
.It Fl U Ar unix-socket
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of IPv6 addresses contained in a file named addressfile.txt and a scamper
process listening on port 31337 configured to probe at 30 packets per second started
as follows:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -P 31337 -p 30
.Pp
the following command will resolve the addresses for aliases, store the raw
measurements in outfile1.warts, and record the interface-pairs that are aliases
in aliases.txt:
.Pp
.Dl sc_speedtrap -p 31337 -a addressfile.txt -o outfile1.warts -A aliases.txt
.Pp
The next example is useful when inferring aliases from multiple vantage points.
Given the output of aliases.txt from a previous measurement, the following
will resolve the addressfile for aliases, skipping those in aliases.txt, and
appending the new aliases to aliases.txt:
.Pp
.Dl sc_speedtrap -p 31337 -a addressfile.txt -o outfile2.warts -A aliases.txt -S aliases.txt
.Pp
To obtain a transitive closure of routers from an input warts file:
.Pp
.Dl sc_speedtrap -d 1 outfile1.warts
.Pp
To obtain a list of the interfaces probed and their IPID behaviour:
.Pp
.Dl sc_speedtrap -d 2 outfile1.warts
.Pp
To obtain statistics of how many probes are sent in each stage, and how long
the stage takes:
.Pp
.Dl sc_speedtrap -d 3 outfile1.warts
