.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and have a set of IPv4 address-pairs tested for aliases using the
Ally technique.
For each address pair in the file,
.Nm
establishes which probe methods (UDP, TCP-ack, ICMP-echo) solicit an
incrementing IP-ID value, and then uses the Ally technique on pairs where
a probe method is able to obtain an incrementing IP-ID for both addresses.
.Nm
can also infer which IP addresses are aliases using the Mercator
common source address technique as a byproduct of the UDP probing that
.Nm
does.
The output of
.Nm
is written to a
.Xr warts 5
file, which can then be processed to extract aliases.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to detach and become a daemon.
.It Fl a Ar infile
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence of
IPv4 address-pairs, one pair per line.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the warts format.
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl U Ar unix-socket
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl d Ar dump-id
specifies the number identifying an analysis to conduct.
The current choices for are 1-3, and are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy 1:
dump aliases inferred using the Ally (IPID-based) technique.
.It
.Sy 2:
dump aliases inferred using the Mercator (common source address based)
technique.
.It
.Sy 3:
dump aliases inferred using both Ally and Mercator techniques.
.El
.It Fl f Ar fudge
specifies the fudge factor to use when (1) inferring if IPIDs are assigned
from a counter, and (2) inferring if two addresses share the same counter.
.It Fl i Ar probe-wait
specifies the inter-probe gap for both ping and Ally measurements,
in milliseconds.  The default is 1000ms (1 second); the minimum is 200ms,
and the maximum is 2000ms.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy nobs:
do not consider byte swapped IPID values when inferring if IPID values
are assigned from a counter.
.It
.Sy tc:
dump transitive closure when reporting aliases.
.El
.It Fl q Ar attempts
specifies the number of times to try Ally when one of the addresses is
unresponsive.
.It Fl t Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl w Ar waittime
specifies the minimum length of time, in seconds, to wait between completing
a measurement to a particular IP address and issuing the next.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of IPv4-address pairs in a file named infile.txt:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
192.0.2.1 192.0.32.10
192.0.2.2 192.0.31.8
192.0.2.3 192.0.30.64
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
and a
.Xr scamper 1
daemon listening on port 31337, then these address-pairs can be tested for
aliases using
.Pp
sc_ally -a infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337
.Pp
To obtain a list of inferred alias pairs using the Ally technique from a
.Xr warts 5
file:
.Pp
sc_ally -d 1 outfile.warts
.Pp
To obtain a list of inferred routers using a transitive closure of alias
pairs inferred using the Ally and Mercator techniques:
.Pp
sc_ally -d 3 -O tc outfile.warts
